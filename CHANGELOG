misr_view 5.3 RELEASE UPDATE
May, 2006
====================================================================

Fixed wraparound issue for orbit values that are larger than what
can be handled by a short integer.
====================================================================

misr_view 5.2 RELEASE UPDATE
September, 2005
====================================================================

misr_view 5.0 RELEASE UPDATE
September, 2004
====================================================================
REVISIONS/CHANGES SINCE VERSION 4.4:

BIG CHANGE: misr_view is now IDL-VM compatible!  Only one caveat: only
the supplied transforms can be used with misr_view running under the
Virtual Machine.  The ability to edit and/or create transforms is
therefore disabled.

To obtain the IDL Virtual Machine FREE OF CHARGE, go to:

http://www.rsinc.com/idlvm/index.asp

Modified simple annotation capability within the "Save Image" utility.
Users can now "scale" images that are either too large or too small
with respect to the color bar and/or title.
====================================================================

misr_view 4.4 RELEASE UPDATE
July 27, 2004
====================================================================
REVISIONS/CHANGES SINCE VERSION 4.2:

Improved consistency with pseudocolor handling on systems with TrueColor 
display devices, notably Macintosh and Windows systems.  XLOADCT and
the color bar option should now work properly on all systems.

Added simple annotation capability within the "Save Image" utility.
Image with 3-line (maximum) title and annotated color bar now supported.

Minor changes in the handling of default sizing of some GUIs.
====================================================================

misr_view 4.2 RELEASE UPDATE
January 22, 2003
====================================================================
The misr_view save files have been updated in order to be fully
compatible with IDL-RT (IDL Run Time).  If IDL-RT is being used to
run misr_view, the following steps need to be followed in order for
misr_view to operate correctly:

(1) Decide which misr_view 4.2 save file is appropriate for your
system (see below for more information)

(2) RENAME the appropriate save file to "misr_view.sav"

(3) Use this renamed save file with IDL-RT

REMEMBER, THESE INSTRUCTIONS ONLY APPLY TO THOSE RUNNING IDL-RT!
Users with full installations of the IDL software can skip the steps
above.
====================================================================


misr_view 4.2 RELEASE UPDATE
January 22, 2003
====================================================================

Minor bug fixes to histogram interface.
Minor bug fixes to AirMISR coordinate calculations.
Minor bug fix with saving data out to vanilla HDF 4.x.
Extended capability to save unscaled data out to NetCDF and flat binary format.
Improved quality of reprojected high-resolution (greater than 1100m) parameters.

SOME OF THE MAJOR CHANGES SINCE VERSION 4.0:

Orbit dates extended through year 2020.
Companion window displays block number, block x and block y.
Vector overlays bug fix; line thickness disabled.
Visual registration of differing resolutions bug fix.
Histogram bug fix.

SOME OF THE MAJOR CHANGES SINCE VERSION 3.3:

Ability to ingest MISR "subsetted" files.
Data transforms.
Map projections.
Vector Overlays.
Color tables and color bar.
Ability to store and recall everything in the data selection interface.
====================================================================
	
========================================================================================
IMPORTANT: A NOTE REGARDING THE PERSPECTIVE VIEWER TOOL
========================================================================================
The data window's Interactive Perspective Viewer Interface tool is a work in progress and
is best used when running misr_view on the user's local system.  If running misr_view over
a network, the perspective tool can be EXTREMELY SLOW to respond to the user's input and,
in some cases, may appear to hang altogether.  Future versions of misr_view will optimize the
perspective tool's speed but for now, discretion and patience is advised when using this tool
over the network.
