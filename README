March 8, 2018

This document is intended to be a brief guide to setting up and running
misr_view.  For more detailed information, please consult the misr_view
user's guide, located in the "ug5.3_html" directory under the "external"
directory or online at https://nasa.github.io/MISR-View/ .
The FAQ below offers additional information.

Once misr_view is unpacked, there should be two top-level directories,
"external" and "src".  The "src" directory contains all of the source
code for all of the modules that comprise misr_view.  The "external"
directory contains all files that are needed to operate misr_view.
Generally speaking, the user does not need to recompile the source
code.

For information regarding the history of changes to misr_view, please
refer to the file "CHANGELOG".

PLEASE READ THE FAQ AT THE END OF THIS DOCUMENT FOR ANSWERS TO COMMON
QUESTIONS REGARDING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN.

STARTING UP MISR_VIEW WITHOUT A LICENSED VERSION OF IDL

=========================================================================
A "licensed version of IDL" means that you have purchased a copy of IDL
from Harris Geospatial Solutions, Inc. (http://www.harrisgeospatial.com).
If you have never dealt with this company, you probably do not have a 
valid IDL license.

In order to run misr_view without an IDL license, the IDL Virtual Machine
(IDL-VM) must be downloaded from the HARRIS website. Due to export 
control policies, download and installation of IDL (and subsequently the
IDL Virtual Machine) requires that you complete the registration and 
verification process via the HARRIS website.  Once done, click on 
'My Account' in the top right-hand corner, navigate to "Downloads", and
then "All Downloads". 
Select the appropriate platform to begin the download and installation 
process.
Installation of the Virtual Machine will not be covered in this document.

(1) Start the IDL-VM by double-clicking the IDL-VM icon or selecting the
IDL-VM via the Start button.

(2) Dismiss the IDL-VM window that appears by clicking the 
"click to continue" button.

(3) When the selection dialog box appears, find and select the
"misr_view.sav" file and click the "OK" button.  "misr_view.sav" will
be located in the "external" directory.

The data selection interface and main console should appear on the
screen.

There are two ways to invoke the IDL-VM on a Mac, either via a terminal
window, or by clicking on the IDL-VM icon.  The latter will be covered 
here, the former below.

(1) Start the IDL-VM by double-clicking the IDL-VM icon.

(2) Dismiss the IDL-VM window that appears by clicking the 
"click to continue" button.

(3) When the selection dialog box appears, find and select the
"misr_view.sav" file and click the "OK" button.  "misr_view.sav" will
be located in the "external" directory.

The data selection interface and main console should appear on the
screen.

Please note that it is assumed that the IDL-VM has been configured
on your system.  If the steps below do not work, most likely the
IDL-VM is not set up properly on your system.  Consult with a system
administrator if you have one, or look at the online documentation
for the IDL-VM (http://www.rsinc.com/idlvm/idlvm.pdf).

(1) In a terminal window, type:

idl -vm

(2) Dismiss the IDL-VM window that appears by clicking the 
"click to continue" button.

(3) When the selection dialog box appears, find and select the
"misr_view.sav" file and click the "OK" button.  "misr_view.sav" will
be located in the "external" directory.

The data selection interface and main console should appear on the
screen.

STARTING UP MISR_VIEW WITH A LICENSED VERSION OF IDL (PRE-COMPILED CODE)

=========================================================================
A "licensed version of IDL" means that you have purchased a copy of IDL
from Harris Geospatial Solutions, Inc. (http://www.harrisgeospatial.com).
If you have never dealt with this company, you probably do not have a 
valid IDL license.
Please see how to run misr_view without an IDL license (above)... Please
note that misr_view users who have a valid IDL license can run misr_view
as unlicensed users do...

If you *do* have a valid IDL license, follow the instructions below for
your specific operating system if you want to invoke misr_view from
pre-compiled code:

---------------
Windows XP/2000/7/Vista
Windows XP/2000/7/Vista
Windows XP/2000/7/Vista
Windows XP/2000/7/Vista
Windows XP/2000/7/Vista
---------------
(1) Start up IDL.

(2) Make the "external" directory the current active directory.  For
example, if the desired current directory is 
C:\misr_stuff\misr_view\external\, the following command
would be entered at the IDL command line:

CD,'C:\misr_stuff\misr_view\external\'

(3) At the IDL command line, type the following:

RESTORE,'misr_view.sav'

(4) Then, simply type:

misr_view

The data selection interface and main console should appear on the
screen.

(1) Start up IDL in either command-line mode or the IDL Development 
Interface, "idlde".
(2) Make the "external" directory the current active directory.  For
example, if the desired current directory is 
/home/misr/misr_view/external/, the following command
would be entered at the IDL command line:

>>> QUESTION: How do I open and access the misr_view user's guide?

>>> ANSWER: First, you must have a common browser available, such as
Netscape, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Mozilla, or Safari.  The assumption
here is that the user knows how to start up the browser application.
Once the browser is active, use the "Open File..." or "Open..." menu item
under the "File" menu to open the file "misr_view_ug5.3.html", which is
located in the "ug5.3_html" directory under the "external" directory.
=========================================================================

=========================================================================
>>> QUESTION: Are there any differences in functionailty when running
misr_view without a valid IDL license?

>>> ANSWER: Yes.  When running misr_view with the IDL-VM, users will not
be able to modify or create transform files.  Some transform files are
provided with misr_view, and these should be sufficient for most users.
The transform interface is described in detail in the misr_view user's
guide.
=========================================================================

=========================================================================
>>> QUESTION: How does one make a directory "active" on a PC so that a 
licensed IDL user can run misr_view?

>>> ANSWER: There are several ways to do this; look in the IDL documents
to see how to add directories to a search list.  Another way to do this
is by using the IDL command "CD".  For example, if the desired current
directory is C:\misr_stuff\misr_view\external\, the following command
would be entered at the IDL command line:

CD,'C:\misr_stuff\misr_view\external\'
